# Graffiti-API
Graffiti Artists / Crew API. 

## What is this?
This is planned to be a proper API, I am starting this as just an artists test api to gather some data, I will extend this to include crew and location endpoints / relationships when I have a proper backend in place and see where it goes from there.

A demo api can be seen at:  https://my-json-server.typicode.com/david-webber/Graffiti-API/artists 

## contributing.

If you have any suggestions please open an issue.
